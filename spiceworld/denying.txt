Ooh, yeah, yeah come on
You think you're quick but, I'd like to see you keep up with me
You think you're slick but, I'd like to see you pull a trick on me
You think you're so cool, Hey big man! you're old school
You think you're smart, but who the hell d'ya think you're talking to

Everyone can see who you are,
Take a look at yourself, tell me why keep on denying
Everything you say (denying) everything you do,
So be a fool to yourself forever more, trying
Any kind of move, tell me, So what's it gonna prove
You ain't fooling nobody
You ain't fooling nobody but yourself

I know you're sweet, But I know you don't wanna be seen that way
Admit defeat, win or lose, Who cares it's just a game you play
I know you need me, If you stay that way it's never gonna be
You got your style, but I know what you really want from me

Everyone can see who you are,
Take a look at yourself, tell me why keep on denying,
Everything you say, denying, everything you do,
So be a fool to yourself forever more, trying,
Any kind of move, tell me, So what's it gonna prove,
You ain't fooling nobody, You ain't fooling nobody but yourself

Ha, ha, check yourself
Check yourself, but don't forget yourself, 'cause you're denying
Ha ha, ha ha, check yourself, ha I don't forget yourself
Check yourself, but don't forget yourself, 'cause you're denying
You're getting everything you are and even everything you need
That's life, come on
ha ha, check yourself

Everyone can see who you are,
Take a look at yourself, tell me why keep on denying,
Everything you say, denying, everything you do,
So be a fool to yourself forever more, trying,
Any kind of move, tell me, So what's it gonna prove,
You ain't fooling nobody,
You ain't fooling nobody, denying,
Everything you say, denying (Everything you say),
Everything you do (Everything you do),
So be a fool to yourself forever more (more), trying,
Any kind of move (Any kind of move), tell me,
So what's it gonna prove (What's it gonna prove),
You ain't fooling nobody, You ain't fooling nobody, denying (Woo), ...
